New global maintainer – Yao Qi

I’m pleased to announce that Yao Qi has accepted an invitation to become
a global maintainer of GDB. He has made quite a few contributions over
the past four years, and is notable for his unfailing good humor despite
digging into ugly parts of the code.
Join us in welcoming him to his augmented responsibility, and feel
free to send him all your patches. 🙂
