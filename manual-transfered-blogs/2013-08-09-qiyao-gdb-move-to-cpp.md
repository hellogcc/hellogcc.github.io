# GDB tends to move to C++?
Posted on 2013/08/09 by yao

There was a heated discussion last year about whether to move GDB to C++. One major objection from one maintainer is that we should share as much code between GDB and GDBserver as we can, however, GDBserver-written-in-C++ probably is unacceptable for resource constraint system. Today, the maintainer changed his mind, and post a mail in gdb mailing list FYI, I’m back on the C++ camp now. it is not an official announcement for the move, but I believe the discussion is unfrozen.

It is time to buy some books on c++,
