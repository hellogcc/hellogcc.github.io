# GDB talk in FOSDEM 2014 (slides and video record)
Posted on 2014/02/13 by yao

Pedro gave a talk on FOSDEM 2014, named "GDB, so where are we now?
Status of GDB's ongoing target and run control projects".  The slides
can be found here
https://github.com/palves/FOSDEM-2014/blob/master/presentation.pdf
Video record is http://video.fosdem.org/2014/previews/fosdem/fosdem_2014/dv/K4201/2014-02-02/13_58_00.ogv

The PDF is very helpful to understand some confusing concepts for both users
and developers, such as all-stop, non-stop, async, and run all-stop on top of non-stop.
