New global maintainer - Yao Qi

I'm pleased to announce that Yao Qi has accepted an invitation to become a global maintainer of GDB. He has made quite a few contributions over the past four years, and is notable for his unfailing good humor despite digging into ugly parts of the code. Join us in welcoming him to his augmented responsibility, and feel free to send him all your patches. :-)
