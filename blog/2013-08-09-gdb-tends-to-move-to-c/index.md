There was a heated discussion last year about whether to move GDB to C++. One major objection from one maintainer is that we should share as much code between GDB and GDBserver as we can, however, `GDBserver-written-in-C++` probably is unacceptable for resource constraint system. Today, the maintainer changed his mind, and post a mail in gdb mailing list [FYI, I'm back on the C++ camp now.](http://sourceware.org/ml/gdb/2013-08/msg00026.html) it is not an official announcement for the move, but I believe the discussion is unfrozen.

It is time to buy some books on c++, :)
